					<div>User management describes the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems, devices, applications, storage systems, networks, SaaS services, and more. User management is a core part to any directory service and is a basic security essential for any organization. User management enables admins to control user access and on-board and off-board users to and from IT resources. Subsequently a directory service will then authenticate, authorize, and audit user access to IT resources based on what the IT admin had dictated.</div>

					<div>Football is my most favorite sport and I like playing it a lot, but it came to an end due to what happened to me in 2016. It was a good day on my vocation during October. On that day, My friend and I planned to go swimming in the afternoon and playing football in the evening. At 2:00 pm, I left home and traveled to the swimming pool at my friend’s boutique near Siem Reap ring road. We spent around two and half hours there by swimming in the water, eating fruits and snacks as well as drink. After that, we departed from the pool to Jonlong sport club, where we had a match. In that game, my team and I faced a strong team and the game was tough. Unfortunately, When I was trying to conquer the ball with opponents, I fell off and broke my left knee. First, it hurts me so much then I couldn’t feel my leg and couldn’t walk. Moreover, I wasn’t able to ride the motorbike, so my friends took me to a clinic and went home. I was afraid to tell my parents until the next day. My mother was angry to hear that and she came back from Phnom Penh to look after me. After mother arrived at Siem Reap, she hired a car and went to a hospital in Surin, Thailand. I met a doctor and get some medicine to cure my knee. Also, the Doctor said that I couldn't play football anymore but I can watch. The same day, my mother and I came back to Cambodia. I didn’t feel good about what happened because I lost what I love, but I follow the doctor's advice to ensure my knee is fine. </div>
